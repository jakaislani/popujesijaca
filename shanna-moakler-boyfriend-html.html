Terri Mellencamp, one of the past contestants of the show, revealed things <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rondeau said</a> about Moakler in her DMs. He had shaded his girlfriend in texts with her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The situation got worse just three days later. February 12 brought the news about Moakler's flirtatious behavior on the show with <a href=# rel=follow>Lamar Odom</a>.</p><p>Once Rondeau noticed this, he reportedly started having doubts about his relationship.</p><p>TMZ again reported, citing "sources with direct knowledge," about Rondeau's <a href=# rel="follow noopener">discontent regarding</a> the "subtle sexual innuendoes flying back and forth" between Moakler and Odom inside the CBB house. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He had been watching the show since she became a part of it and had felt like she was crossing boundaries.</p><p>Valentine's Day could be the worst Day to let the world know you might have broken up with your girlfriend. But Rondeau did just that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On February 14, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Page Six</a> reported that he had deleted all his posts with Moakler from his Instagram. He even unfollowed her on the platform. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Of course, Moakler didn't know about this since she was still on the show. Page Six also approached him for an explanation for his deeds.</p><p>He only replied with a cryptic, "Soon they will know."</p><p>That same Day, Moakler got eliminated from CBB. She had gushed about her relationship with her boyfriend right before her exit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But her exit meant she was back in the real world and immediately noticed the mess.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By the next Day, she, too, made her moves. On February 15, Us Weekly reported that Moakler, too, had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unfollowed Rondeau</a> on Instagram.</p><p>However, she had not deleted her posts with him at the time of the reporting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Shanna Moakler and Matthew Rondeau's Relationship</h2><p>Moakler and Rondeau <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started going out</a>&nbsp;in 2020. Their courtship started as an off-again-on-again thing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And it has been the same throughout their time together. In July 2021, Rondeau revealed that they had broken up.</p><p>In fact, he admitted they had broken up "months ago," saying, "sometimes love isn't enough," and it was disappointing things hadn't worked out between them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>However, by October, they had gotten back together. It was also the first time engagement was brought up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A source close to the couple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Us Weekly</a> at the time that they could even get engaged soon.</p><p>But that didn't happen. Instead, in February 2022, Rondeau was arrested for felony&nbsp;domestic violence.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The police were involved after he posted an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram video</a> launching&nbsp;derogatory comments about Moakler. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He alleged she was cheating on him with their neighbor and claimed their relationship was over.&nbsp;</p><p>After the reported arrest, a representative for&nbsp;Moakler confirmed she was okay and surrounded by family and friends.</p><p>Her daughter&nbsp;Alabama also came forward, stating her mom was fine and her ex boyfriend Rondeau "needed serious help."</p><p>Nearly a month after, Moakler then surprised her fans with her pregnancy news. But she later clarified that she was not pregnant and had received a false positive test.&nbsp;</p><p>"I received a&nbsp;false positive test&nbsp;due to the fact I had taken a hormone called HCG to help me lose weight for&nbsp;Big Brother," she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While she clarified she was not pregnant, she did hint at her desire&nbsp;to be pregnant. She stated having more kids down the line was "not out of the question for me."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Moakler already has three kids from her previous relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>She gave birth to two children: daughter&nbsp;Alabama and son Landon while being married to Barker from 2004 to 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>Before that, the Miss USA 1995 had already welcomed a daughter named Atiana with her ex-fiance&nbsp;De La Hoya.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuYlruvrYymppqjnJq%2Fbq7Osp2roZWjsW%2B006aj</p></div><div id=links><a href=./upgrading-from-an-intel-core-i7-2600k-testing-sandy-bridge-in-2019.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gaming: Far Cry 5 - Upgrading from an Intel Core i7-2600K: Testing Sandy Bridge in 2019</a>
