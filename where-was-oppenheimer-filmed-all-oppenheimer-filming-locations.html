Since then, reports have emerged around the filming locations used for the movie, which by all accounts have remained largely true to the actual locales frequented by the real Oppenheimer throughout his life and career. Alongside their surrounding regions, principal filming locations included Los Alamos in New Mexico, as well as two university campuses in California and a third in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-1.jpg><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a>, pre-production on Oppenheimer began in January of last year, with filming commencing the following month and wrapping in May.

The town is recognized as the real-world site where Oppenheimer and his team conceived and created the atomic bomb, as well as where they undertook various experiments. Los Alamos — then referred to by the secret code name “Site Y” — was the central hub of the so-called Manhattan Project that birthed nuclear weaponry, and home to the Los Alamos National Laboratory where such weapons were designed.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Per Hidden Remote, a custom set was built in the Los Alamos region, which is known for its isolation and inaccessibility. Oppenheimer’s family home during his time in Los Alamos was also reportedly used as a location for filming, as well as the so-called Oppenheimer House in Los Alamos’ historical museum. Per to <a href=#>boots on the ground</a>, filming in Los Alamos also stretched to the nearby regions of Santa Fe and Abiquiu, New Mexico, as well as Santa Clarita and Sierra Madre, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LatLong</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oppenheimer Trailer – Work commences on the construction of a secret town on the site of the Los Alamos Rach School, which would be home to the families of some of the top scientists in the world during the project.

The real-life Oppenheimer was a professor at UC Berkeley from 1929 to 1943, and the site was reportedly transformed to visually recall this period for Oppenheimer’s filming. According to Hidden Remote, scenes for the film were shot in the actual UC Berkeley buildings where Oppenheimer taught, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sceen It </a>also reporting that Edwards Stadium — located on Fulton Street on the southwest corner of the Berkeley campus — was likewise used for shooting.

Murphy was elsewhere seen shooting outside Wheeler Hall and the main library, which was redesigned with new lampposts.

Notably, Oppenheimer himself tenured at the LA campus, and gave several lectures in the building. While specific filming locations within the campus remain scarce, both Murphy and Pugh were reportedly spotted on the university grounds in February.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Pugh’s shooting location makes sense, since the actress is set to portray UCLA physics professor and romantic interest of Oppenheimer’s, Jean Tatlock.
