An ardent socialist as a youth, Mussolini followed in his father's political footsteps but was expelled by the party for his support of World War I. As dictator during World War II, he overextended his forces and was eventually killed by his own people in Mezzegra, Italy.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Family and Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883, in Italy. His father, Alessandro, was a blacksmith and an impassioned socialist who spent much of his time on politics and much of his money on his mistress. His mother, Rosa (Maltoni), was a devout Catholic teacher who provided the family with some stability and income.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The eldest of three children, Mussolini showed much intelligence as a youth but was boisterous and disobedient. His father instilled in him a passion for socialist politics and defiance against authority. Though he was expelled from several schools for bullying and defying school authorities, he eventually obtained a teaching certificate in 1901 and, for a brief time, worked as a schoolmaster.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Socialist Party</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1902, Mussolini moved to Switzerland to promote socialism. He quickly gained a reputation for his magnetism and remarkable rhetorical talents. While engaging in political demonstrations, he caught the attention of Swiss authorities and was eventually expelled from the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mussolini returned to Italy in 1904 and continued promoting a socialist agenda. He was briefly imprisoned and, upon release, became editor of the organization's newspaper, Avanti (meaning "Forward"), which gave him a larger megaphone and expanded his influence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Mussolini initially condemned Italy's entry into <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/world-war-i-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War I" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War I</a>, he soon saw the war as an opportunity for his country to become a great power. His change in attitude broke ties with fellow socialists, and he was expelled from the organization.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1915, Mussolini joined the Italian army and fought on the front lines, reaching the rank of corporal before being wounded and discharged from the military.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fascist Party Founder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On March 23, 1919, Mussolini <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mussolini-founds-the-fascist-party data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="founded the Fascist Party" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">founded the Fascist Party</a>, which organized several right-wing groups into a single force. The fascist movement proclaimed opposition to social class discrimination and supported nationalist sentiments. Mussolini hoped to raise Italy to levels of its great Roman past.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mussolini’s Rise to Power</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mussolini criticized the Italian government for weakness at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/treaty-of-versailles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Treaty of Versailles" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Treaty of Versailles</a>. Capitalizing on public discontent following World War I, he organized a paramilitary unit known as the "Black Shirts," who terrorized political opponents and helped increase Fascist influence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Italy slipped into political chaos, Mussolini declared that only he could restore order and was given the authority in 1922 as prime minister. He gradually dismantled all democratic institutions. By 1925, he had made himself dictator, taking the title "Il Duce" ("the Leader").</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To his credit, Mussolini carried out an extensive public works program and reduced unemployment, making him very popular with the people.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Invasion of Ethiopia</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1935, determined to show the strength of his regime, Benito Mussolini invaded Ethiopia. The ill-equipped Ethiopians were no match for Italy's modern tanks and airplanes, and the capital, Addis Ababa, was quickly captured. Mussolini incorporated Ethiopia into the new Italian Empire.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">World War II and Adolf Hitler</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Impressed with Italy's early military successes, German dictator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/adolf-hitler-9340144 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Adolf Hitler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Adolf Hitler</a> sought to establish a relationship with Mussolini. Flattered by Hitler's overtures, Mussolini interpreted the recent diplomatic and military victories as proof of his genius. In 1939, Mussolini sent support to Fascists in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, hoping to expand his influence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Italy and Germany <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-pact-of-steel-is-signed-the-axis-is-formed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="signed a military alliance" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">signed a military alliance</a> known as the "Pact of Steel." With Italy's resources stretched to capacity, many Italians believed Mussolini’s alliance with Germany would provide time to regroup. Influenced by Hitler, Mussolini instituted discrimination policies against the Jews in Italy. In 1940, Italy invaded Greece with some initial success.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hitler's invasion of Poland and declaration of war with Britain and France forced Italy into war, however, and exposed weaknesses in its military. Greece and North Africa soon fell, and only German military intervention in early 1941 saved Mussolini from a military coup.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roosevelt-and-churchill-begin-casablanca-conference data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Casablanca Conference" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Casablanca Conference</a> in 1942, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/winston-churchill-9248164 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Winston Churchill" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/franklin-d-roosevelt-9463381 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin D. Roosevelt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> devised a plan to take Italy out of the war and force Germany to move its troops to the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union. Allied forces secured a beachhead in Sicily and began marching up the Italian peninsula.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With pressure mounting, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mussolini-falls-from-power data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mussolini was forced to resign" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mussolini was forced to resign</a> on July 25, 1943, and was arrested; German commandos later rescued him. Mussolini then moved his government to northern Italy, hoping to regain his influence. On June 4, 1944, Rome was liberated by Allied forces, who marched on to take control of Italy.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mussolini and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, were executed on April 28, 1945, in Mezzegra (near Dongo), Italy, and their bodies were hung on display in a Milan plaza. Following the liberation of Rome by Allied forces, the pair had attempted to escape to Switzerland but were captured by the Italian underground on April 27, 1945.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Italian masses greeted Mussolini's death without regret. Mussolini had promised his people Roman glory, but his megalomania had overcome his common sense, bringing them only war and misery.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Benito Mussolini</li><li>Birth Year: 1883</li><li>Birth date: July 29, 1883</li><li>Birth City: Dovia di Predappio, Forlì</li><li>Birth Country: Italy</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Benito Mussolini created the Fascist Party in Italy in 1919, eventually making himself dictator prior to World War II.
