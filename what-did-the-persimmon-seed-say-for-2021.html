If the inside of the seed looks like a fork, the area can expect a mild winter; a spoon, a lot of snow; and a knife, bitter cold “cut like a knife” winter.<h2>What is the wives tale about persimmon seeds?</h2>So what did the seeds say? According to folklore, if you crack open a persimmon seed from a ripe fruit and the shape inside (called a cotyledon) looks like a fork, winter will be mild; if you see a spoon, there will be a lot of snow, and if there is a knife, winter will be bitingly cold and “cut like a knife.”<h2>Does a persimmon tell the weather?</h2>According to the Farmer's Almanac, you can get a sense of the coming winter based on the shape of the cotyledon inside a ripe persimmon. A few of the shapes and corresponding weather patterns include: Fork shape = winter will be mild. Spoon shape = there will be a lot of snow.<h2>Persimmon Seed Reading in Appalachia~Winter 21/22</h2><p></p><h2>How do you predict the number of snowfalls?</h2>So how do meteorologists forecast snowfall?

More black than orange means winter will be severe.<h2>What does an all black Wooly worm mean for winter?</h2>According to weather folklore, the more black on a woolly worm in the fall means a longer, colder, and possibly snowier winter, to come.
