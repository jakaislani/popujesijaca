Was HeResponsible for UFC Bantam</h1><div id=sub-header>June 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Most combat sports fans might know about the rough upbringing of the famed boxing legend, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Mike Tyson</a>. Tyson’s father, Jimmy Kirkpatrick abandoned the family leaving Tyson with his mother, who was also a victim of substance abuse. The 57-year-old gradually turned into a “wild kid” who stole things and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>ended up in juvenile detention just at the age of 13</a>. But, the youngest Heavyweight boxing champion isn’t the only instance of a combat sports athlete with a troubled childhood.</p><p>Even a number of UFC fighters have also been through an unruly childhood. Most UFC fans are already aware of how the noted Diaz’ brothers, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Nick</a> and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Nate</a>, had spent their childhood days. Both of them have also revealed that sometimes they had no idea about where would they get their next meal from. Although, the famed current UFC Bantamweight champ, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Aljamain Sterling</a>, didn’t have to face any such issues. His childhood, too, was far from something one would like to have.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Aljamain Sterling’s abusive childhood</h2><p>Sterling has opened up regarding his traumatic childhood in a UFC documentary created about him. He has stated that his father, Cleveland Sterling, was the prime reason behind his traumatic childhood. Growing up in a small household with seven siblings and six half-siblings, Sterling recognized his primary responsibility of standing by his mom at a tender age.</p><p>Sterling revealed that he would regularly keep the house clean and help his little siblings with their daily chores. He has also stated that his father used to be absent most of the time. But his father used to indulge in severe violence and beat up his mother most of the time when he was around. ‘Funk Master’ has narrated one such incident in the YouTube documentary as well.</p><p>He stated, “There was one time they were fighting in the kitchen and my dad was beating my mom up and I remember him going outside, like trying to leave, coming back, going for a knife, I just remember her calling for me, just hearing her voice call for me, screaming and pain like that and her voice pretty much gone.”</p><p>Even a UFC champion with a tough spirit like Sterling took multiple breaks while revealing his story. Quite apparently, it was really hard for him to recollect those traumatic visuals of the times he had seen. It’s also pretty understandable no one would want to have a dreaded childhood like the 34-year-old Jamaican-American.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Aljamain Sterling compared his UFC career to his estranged father</h2><p>In his UFC documentary, Sterling also revealed how his father was never accepting of his abilities. In an almost two-month-old appearance on the noted YouTuber-boxer, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jake Paul’s</a> podcast, Sterling opined his UFC career could be compared to his father’s characteristics. He implied how he felt every time he had to “prove something” to continue fighting for the promotion.</p><p>Most UFC fans might already know that Sterling wasn’t pretty keen to accept the UFC 292 bout against <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Sean O’Malley</a>. But after some to-and-fro of words with <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dana White</a>, ‘Funk Master’ <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>finally had to accept what the UFC planned for him</a>. At Paul’s podcast, the Jamaican-American compared this testing nature of the UFC to his father.</p><p>He said, “So I look at them like my dad, where I almost feel like I need to prove something to pops, to be like, ‘Oh yeah, you think this, ‘I’m gonna show you motherf**ker,’ for me.”</p><p>Well, a large chunk of fans might also know how a massive portion of the UFC community hated Sterling, even after becoming the champion. He had to prove his worth with title defenses and is still hated by many. But several fans might agree with ‘Funk Master’s words here.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>How has wrestling helped Aljamain Sterling make his own path?</h2><p>A neighborhood ruled by gang violence had also been one of Sterling’s major childhood issues. He often witnessed his siblings returning home from school with black eyes and injuries. He also had to see one of his brothers get arrested at a comparatively tender age, which hardened his resolve to refrain from that path. The young Sterling opted to indulge himself in sports for a greater purpose.</p><p>But his vision of playing basketball ended after getting cut out of the school team for his height of 5 feet 4 inches. But the wrestling coach of his school, Tim Godoy, found his small yet strong physique to be apt for wrestling. Sterling obliged his words and started to wrestle. Later on, it became the only place where he found solace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1231521147.jpg><p>‘ESPN’ once reported ‘Funk Master’s’ words about his connection to wrestling. He mentioned, “I fell in love with the sport. After that, wrestling was my avenue to go to college“. Sterling also got to know the famed current UFC Heavyweight champ, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jon Jones</a>, due to his ties to wrestling. The two then-future UFC fighters met at the State University of New York at Morrisville. ‘Bones’ also told Sterling that he was training to become an MMA fighter and shared some videos with him.</p><p>After watching them, Sterling fell for the sport immediately, although he wasn’t sure about pursuing it. But he finally started training with ‘Bones’ himself and started competing as an amateur MMA athlete shortly. He turned professional in the year 2011 and the rest of his journey is known by most MMA fans.</p><p>Do you see ‘Funk Master’ holding on to his UFC Bantamweight title at the end of his UFC 292?</p><p><strong>Watch this Story – <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“I’m Gonna Take Him to Dark Waters”- Aljamain Sterling Lays Bare His Intentions for Sean O’Malley for UFC 292 Amid Back and Forth With Title Contender</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SfmmalnZZ6r7HWrGSwoJ9itrR5wKWhmqWRnrtuv9OeqaWhnpzAbrHSramappeasW6ywK2fnqpdmLmmwsSlmKecXajBpr7LoqWgZaeWwG60xGapnqugpLu0tcGlnGaen6d6trLCZpmapqSWurixyKCfrWWjqa6zv4yama6rmauybq%2FHoqOdoJ%2BksXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./new-doritos-baja-fiery-mango-review.html>&#171;&nbsp;Doritos Baja Fiery Mango: Our Honest Review| Sporked</a>
