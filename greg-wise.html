Born in 1964, late Clare Wise was 18 months older than Greg and they were raised in the North of England together.&nbsp;</p><p>After losing his own sister, Greg has taken part in the five-part series of The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off. &nbsp;In turn, the star must compete against a whole host of other celebrities including R<strong>ussell Brand, Big Narstie, and Johnny Vegas</strong>.</p><h2>How much is Greg Wise worth?</h2><p>Working in the media industry since 1992, Greg Wise&nbsp;definitely made a heavy amount of money throughout his acting and producing career.
