While he sold his old home in 2015, he continued helping other people who were struggling with addiction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He even channeled his experiences into writing a stage play called The End of Longing, which debuted in London in 2016. “It’s personal, but it’s an exaggerated form of me. Jack, the character I play, is a much different drunk than I was,” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2017/legit/news/matthew-perry-friends-reunion-play-1202452798/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Variety</a>. “It flew out of me, this play.
