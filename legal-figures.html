In the 2000s, Cohen began working for future President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>, where he earned a reputation for loyalty and ferocity. His work on behalf of Trump during the 2016 campaign, including the payment of $130,000 to adult film star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/stormy-daniels data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stormy Daniels" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stormy Daniels</a>, along with his possible involvement in attempts to cover-up purported collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, landed Cohen in the crossfires of the investigation being led by special counsel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/robert-mueller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Mueller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Mueller</a>. In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and bank fraud, while also claiming that he made illegal campaign contributions under the direction of Trump. He began serving a three-year prison sentence in May 2019.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Law School</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Michael Dean Cohen was born on August 25, 1966, in Lawrence, New York, a Nassau County suburb of New York City. Cohen’s surgeon father Maurice escaped Nazi persecution before emigrating to the United States, and Cohen’s mother Sondra was a nurse. Cohen attended American University and received his law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School, one of the lowest-ranked law schools in the nation.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Legal and Business Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen began his career as a personal injury lawyer in 1992, eventually opening his own practice. A self-proclaimed entrepreneur from an early age (he claimed to have run a business importing automobiles while in college), he and his family purchased dozens of then-lucrative taxicab “medallions” that allowed them to operate a fleet of taxis in both New York and Chicago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Cohen would later argue that he did not handle the day-to-day management of this business, in 2017 he and his wife were sued by the NY State Department of Taxation for nearly $40,000 in back taxes. In the spring of 2018, Cohen’s purported partner in the business agreed to cooperate with prosecutors regarding his own legal troubles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen has also focused on the New York City real estate market, where he has bought and sold a number of properties. Prior to his work for Trump, Cohen also invested in a casino cruise ship business, a series of medical clinics and billing companies and also held a small stake in a family-run club in Brooklyn. The club has been accused of being a base of operation for several Russian-American gangsters, and in the 1980s, Cohen’s uncle (the primary owner) was accused of providing medical advice to members of the notorious Lucchese crime family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen briefly flirted with politics, losing a lopsided race for a New York City Council seat in 2003, and launching a short-lived campaign for the state senate in 2010.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Relationship With Trump</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His association with Trump began in 2006 when Cohen (who had already purchased several apartments in Trump-owned buildings) assisted Trump in an ongoing battle with a condominium board at a Trump property near the United Nations. An impressed Trump offered Cohen a position within the Trump Organization, and he eventually rose to the role of special counsel and Executive Vice President. He also served on the board of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/eric-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eric Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eric Trump</a> Foundation and was co-president of the company that managed Trump’s Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen’s work was not limited to a legal and real estate portfolio, as he also became an adviser willing to do whatever Trump required. As Cohen told ABC News in 2011, when Trump was mulling a run for president (he opted out), “If somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn’t like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump’s benefit.” He went on to describe his tactics, saying” If you do something wrong, I’m going to come at you, grab you by the neck, and I’m not going to let you go until I’m finished.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen also earned a reputation for going after perceived media slights against Trump, threatening to sue a satirical news site in 2013 for what he called a defamatory article and in 2015 attacking a reporter investigating allegations of abuse (later retracted) by Trump’s first wife, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ivana-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ivana class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ivana</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Role in Trump’s Presidential Campaign and Daniels Affair</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen and others repeatedly urged Trump to run for election prior to 2016, and when Trump did enter the 2016 race, Cohen became a key surrogate, appearing on numerous talk shows to defend Trump. Following Trump’s election, he was named the Republican National Committee’s deputy national finance chair, responsible for much of the group’s fundraising. He also left his position at the Trump Organization but continued to serve as Trump’s personal lawyer for several months.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Steele Dossier and Wikileaks</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen was named in the Steele dossier, a controversial document compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, which alleges a conspiracy between the Russian government and Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. Among its claims are that Cohen traveled to Prague in the summer of 2016 to facilitate a cover-up (including cash payments) of illicit operations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen denied any involvement and stated that he did not travel to the region during the campaign. However, in April 2018, reports emerged that Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s involvement, possibly had evidence placing Cohen in the Czech Republic at the time of the purported meetings. That same month, Cohen dropped a defamation lawsuit against the news site BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS, the research and intelligence company that commissioned the dossier.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Daniels Case and Essential Consultants LLC</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 2018, it was revealed that Cohen paid Stephanie Clifford, also known by her adult film name Stormy Daniels, $130,000 in the fall of 2016. The payment was made with regards to Daniels’ claim of a 2006 affair with Trump. Cohen initially claimed to have made the payment out of his own funds, and that Trump was not involved in the matter. It later emerged that Trump had directly reimbursed Cohen, and President Trump admitted that Cohen had represented him in the matter (although he continued to deny any affair).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen sued Daniels for breaking the terms of a non-disclosure agreement related to the payment, and Daniels countersued, alleging the NDA was invalid because it had never been signed by Trump.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2018, reports emerged regarding Essential Consultants LLC, the limited liability company Cohen set up to facilitate the Daniels payment. Records show that Cohen and Essential Consulting received more than $4.4 million in funds from a variety of foreign and domestic businesses, including AT&T, Swiss healthcare giant Novartis, Korean Aerospace Industries and Columbus Nova, an American-run investment firm with ties to a Russian oligarch who has been sanctioned by the U.S. government. Each of the firms stated that they hired Cohen following President Trump’s election to provide consulting and adviser services.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">FBI Raid and Criminal Investigation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On April 9, 2018, Cohen’s office, home and hotel room were raided by the FBI, as part of an investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The case was referred to the U.S. Attorney by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, and investigators seized emails, phone records, tax and bank statements and other materials relating to both Cohen’s work on behalf of Trump and other clients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June, it was announced that Cohen was parting ways with the legal team that had advised him up to that point in the criminal investigation. It was later revealed that he had hired Guy Petrillo, a former chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, as well as Lanny Davis, a longtime associate of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/bill-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bill Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bill Clinton</a>'s.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Turning on Trump</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In July, Cohen sat down with ABC's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/george-stephanopoulos data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Stephanopoulos" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Stephanopoulos</a> for his first in-depth interview since the FBI seized his files in April. While declining to discuss specific issues related to the investigation, Cohen said he believed that Mueller would find no evidence of improper dealings with Russian agents on his part. He also delivered some eye-opening comments about his former boss, including criticism of Trump's demonization of the FBI and willingness to accept <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/vladimir-putin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vladimir Putin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vladimir Putin</a>'s denials of tampering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen emphasized that "My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will," adding fuel to the rumor that he would offer up knowledge damaging to the president to secure a better deal from prosecutors. As for how he would respond if Trump attempted to discredit him, he insisted he would stand up for himself. "I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone's defense strategy," he said. "I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A few weeks later, Cohen released a two-year-old secret recording of a conversation with Trump about plans to buy the story rights of another woman, Playboy model Karen McDougal, who went on record around the same time as Stormy Daniels about an alleged affair with the president. Amid the occasionally muffled audio, Cohen is heard discussing the need to set up a company to arrange the payment, though it is unclear what directions followed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The president subsequently lashed out at Cohen on Twitter, saying it was "so sad" that a lawyer would tape his client, while new Trump attorney <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/rudolph-giuliani data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rudy Giuliani" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rudy Giuliani</a> insisted that the recording provided no evidence of wrongdoing on his client's part.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Continuing down that path, Cohen reportedly leaked word that he was prepared to share with Mueller his account of how the then-presidential candidate gave the go-ahead for the July 2016 Trump Tower meeting between key campaign members, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/donald-trump-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump Jr.</a> and son-in-law <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jared-kushner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jared Kushner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jared Kushner</a>, and Russian agents who promised damaging information on opponent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/hillary-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hillary Clinton</a>. Later, Cohen's lawyer, Davis, copped to being the one who had informed the media about Trump's supposed knowledge of the meeting, though he admitted that "the only person who could confirm that information is my client."</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Plea Deal and Sentencing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After accepting a deal with prosecutors, Cohen appeared in a Manhattan federal court on August 21, 2018, to plead guilty to charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and illegal campaign contributions. He told the judge that the illegal contributions—payments to Clifford and McDougal to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with Trump—were "in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office," implicating the president in a federal crime.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen, who faced up to 65 years in prison for the charges, was expected to receive a sentence ranging from 46 to 63 months. The agreement also left open the possibility that he could cooperate with Mueller's investigation into Russian election tampering and receive a recommendation for an even lighter sentence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On December 12, 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $1.39 million in restitution, $500,000 in forfeiture and $100,000 in fines.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The troubled lawyer returned to the news in January 2019, when BuzzFeed reported that President Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to law enforcement officials involved. Cohen had previously claimed that such negotiations were over by the beginning of 2016, before admitting that they continued well into the year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen was scheduled to testify before the House Oversight Committee shortly after that, but he postponed his appearance over what he described as ongoing threats against his family. In February, it was announced that the New York state Supreme Court had disbarred Cohen due to his federal conviction for making false statements to Congress.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">House Testimony</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In late February 2019, Cohen appeared before Congress for three days of testimony. With two days of questioning held behind closed doors, the must-see event was the televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on February 27.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Saying he was "here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump," Cohen testified that Trump was aware in advance of both the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians to get information on Hillary Clinton and the WikiLeaks dump of DNC emails around that time; that the candidate was continuing to pursue a deal on the construction of a Trump Tower in Moscow well into the 2016 campaign; and that the president had orchestrated the plan to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, offering copies of checks as evidence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cohen also described how Trump often understated his net worth for tax purposes and instructed him to threaten someone to prevent the release of potentially damaging information.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His statements were met with significant pushback from the president's supporters, who sought to discredit him as a liar and convicted felon. During one contentious back-and-forth with Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who accused Cohen of denying the federal charges against him, Cohen replied, "Shame on you, Mr. Jordan. That's not what I said. Shame on you."</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Prison</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On May 6, 2019, Cohen reported to the Federal Correctional Institute outside Otisville, New York, to begin serving his sentence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In April 2020, Cohen's attorney told the media that his client would be released from prison due to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement.
