A colleague suggested The Juilliard School; Yale University; New York University; and Purchase College, part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She wanted to apply for all four but only had enough money for one application fee, so she chose Juilliard, according to her memoir, Finding Me.

It was the difference between making the decision to become an actor, then training to become the best actor I could be, and finally putting everything that I learned to task.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">First Tony Award</h2><img alt="august wilson, wearing a tuxedo, and viola davis, wearing a white and purple dress, arriving at radio city music hall for the 55th tony awards" title="August Wilson and Viola Davis (nominated for Featured Actres" width=2048 height=1494 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/august-wilson-and-viola-davis-arrive-at-radio-city-music-news-photo-1675787626.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">New York Daily News Archive</span><span class="css-180xbpm eewc14j0">//</span><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Playwright August Wilson and Viola Davis at the 55th Tony Awards, when she won for Best Actress in a play. Davis has appeared in several Wilson adaptations throughout her career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After several years of off-Broadway parts and small roles on television and movies, Davis returned to the Broadway stage in 2001 with King Hedley II, also penned by Wilson. She portrayed Tanya, the title character’s wife, who considers getting an abortion in one of the play’s most memorable monologues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Davis received rave reviews; <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://old.post-gazette.com/magazine/20010502hedley6.asp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="theater critic Christopher Rawson wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">theater critic Christopher Rawson wrote</a> that she “has a dead-on intensity which, when she launches into her great aria about parenthood and death, sweeps all before it.” Davis was again nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress (Featured Role – Play), and this time she won it.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film Breakthrough in Doubt</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Several years later, Davis received her most widespread attention to date with her role in the 2008 film Doubt, adapted from Scott Rudin’s Tony-winning play. “I knew this was it,” Davis wrote in Finding Me. “This was the game-changing role.” She played the mother of the only Black student in a Catholic parish school, who may have been abused by one of the priests.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Davis appears in only one 10-minute scene, but as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/doubt-2008 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="film critic Roger Ebert wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">film critic Roger Ebert wrote</a>, “it is the emotional heart and soul of Doubt, and if Viola Davis isn’t nominated by the Academy, an injustice will have been done.” She, indeed, did receive her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Production Company Formed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, Davis and her husband, Julius Tennon, co-founded JuVee Productions, a production company that develops and produces independent films, television, theater, and digital projects.
